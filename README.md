## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

I deepened my Tailwind skills and tackled a more challenging project with React / Next. I feel like I've learned so much simply by experimenting around with these frameworks. I'm gradually figuring out how to efficiently develop using components and hooks. Prior to this challenge I was unsure of how hooks work and what their advantages are. But throught the project, things started making sense. Sometimes I would complicate things more than I should've by passing on too many props between components and keeping closely related componets far away from each other. After completing this project, I'm definitely tackling the next one with a different mindset.

### Continued development

Going forward I'd like to get to know other CSS frameworks like Sass, and also work with Typescript. I'll continue with React / Next because I still have a lot to learn about them, and I want to become as comfortable with them as I am with vanilla JavaScript.
